	<p>The first hustle was farm labourer back in the 2014's. this was imeaditely after high school.In this job the laboureers were assigned a piece of land where they were to work and after that they were paid. i workeed hard here and i was recognised as one of the most hardworking guy there.
	</p>
	<p> The hardwork eas not in vain as it helped me rise the ladder to become one of the three topmost guys in his farm. Whin no time the other guys left and i as supposed to coodinate the workers, plan where they would work, howthey would get tea and how they would get paid. This was the first time that leadership skills were required in my life.</p>
	<p>Leadership was must because as you were dealing with people from all ages,gender and all walks of life</p>
	<p> I could rise up and get out of the house even before my dad- as early as 5am. This was early considering that mostly jobs time was eight o'clock.</p>
	<p> When i rised that early i went to do the irrigation and since the land was entensive we hard to start it early.</p>
	<p> The process ofirrigation was not very simple and as you have to change the pipes manually and irrigate manually. Thisis howthe process goes you have pipes connected up the distance your farms is and the finally to the horse pipe.When the pump pushes the water then it follow the pipes up the hill to the garden.</p>
	<p> I the garden there fallow like ridges where you add water untill they are full.Once its full you shift to another fallow and once all your fallowws are full then you have to add another pipe and the process continues.</p>
