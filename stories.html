<p>The first financial story am going to give is of certain guy.This guy is my friend he worked out his life in various jobs from quarry worker to construction jobs. He started of as a good helperin the quarry, where they carried stones to the stone crusher.The stones carried were much sharp than the sharpest knives.
</p>
<p> the first day was like hell to him he joined the other guys who were aligned in a line to pass the stones since the terraine was not favourable to walk with much weight. </p>
 <p>He was passed the first stone and all that would follow was flowing blood in his hands. He wonder where did that blood came from only to realise that it's a cut from the stones. </p>
 <p>The weekly pay was $18 plus tea in teabreak and lunch. that was back in 2017.</p>
 <p>
  he said,"i remembere the first time i went to construction siyer i was assigned to avery hard work-casting." This is oneof the most feared jobs in the construction sites. He went for that as a way of saying that it was just away of passing time and away of earning a few coins.</p>
  <p>
   This was one of the most difficult time in his construction times. The reason is because it involved scooping concrete and putting it on a rised platform. He said the job was assigned two guys only to realise that it was supposed to be three guys. When the third guywas added as booster he didnt even push for 30mins and he surrendered.</p><p>From there he continued to some other sites.</p>
